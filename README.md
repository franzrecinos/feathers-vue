# feathers-vue

A full-stack starter with Vue.js 2, Feathers.js 2, webpack and MongoDB

- Support for [ES6](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/).

- `/client` was generated by [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) with [vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) 2.0 support, and webpack template [webpack](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack).

- `/server` is generated by [feathers-cli](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-cli). The default back-end database is [mongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/), but you can easily switch to any other database thanks to [feathers](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers)'s [universal database interface](https://docs.feathersjs.com/databases/readme.html). Feathers public folder was removes as application will be served from the pubclic folder.

- [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) 2 for front-end routing.

- [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) may be integrated in the feature.

- `/public/index.html`: the front-end entry page.

- `/.babelrc` disables babel's module translation, letting webpack handle the module packing with its tree-shaking feature.

git clone ...
